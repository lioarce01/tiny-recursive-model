# Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) Implementation

This repository contains a complete PyTorch implementation of Samsung's Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) for reasoning tasks, as described in the paper "Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks".

TRM is a lightweight recursive architecture designed to excel at abstract reasoning tasks, including solving ARC-AGI puzzles, Sudoku puzzles, and maze pathfinding problems. The model uses a recursive approach to iteratively update latent states through multiple reasoning steps to solve complex reasoning challenges.
